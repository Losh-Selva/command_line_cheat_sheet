# **Cheat sheet** 

## **Terminal commands**

`pwd`- allows the user to print the working directory hence, allowing us to find what folder we're currently in. 

 `ls`- enables the user to understand what files and folders reside within the current directory.
- `ls -l` gives the user additional information on the files in the directory such as: file size and recent modification 
- `ls -al` will show all files including any that may have been hidden. 

`cd`- command allows the user to change directory, enabling them to move anywhere they like. 
- if we ever get lost we can use commanads like `cd ~` or `cd ..` to move directly to the home directory or up a level, respectively. 

ðŸ’­ Remember to use the *tab* key to cycle through your options quicker, which will save you a lot of time in the long run!

`mkdir`
